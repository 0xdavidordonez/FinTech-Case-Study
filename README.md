# FinTech-Case-Study
  By David Ordonez Martel

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
  Energy Web Foundation
* When was the company incorporated?
  2017
* Who are the founders of the company?
  Energy web chain co-founded by globally respected energy think-and-do tank Rocky Mountain Institute
  (RMI) and noted blockchain developer Grid
  Singularity (GSy), along with a cohort of 10 founding Affiliates.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  Energy Web started in 2017 as a joint initiative between RMI, a global non-profit with decades of experience identifying pathways to profitably decarbonize the energy sector, and Grid Singularity, a noted blockchain developer who saw the technology’s promise in the energy sector, along with a cohort of 10 founding energy companies. Energy Web aims to make the global energy transition successful,  by implementing digital technology that enables a fundamentally different way of working; namely, radically reducing the cost and complexity of coordinating a multiplicity of companies with different roles, objectives, and IT systems.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  The Energy Web Foundation has conducted several rounds of funding over two years, raising approximately $20 million and selling 21 million Energy Web Token, EWT coins.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  Energy Web is a global company on a mission to accelerate the energy transition by developing and deploying open-source Web3 technologies that help companies unlock business value from clean and distributed energy resources
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  EW is currently focused on developing Green Proofs solutions in the following markets within the global energy sector:
   -Decarbonizing electric vehicle charging by enabling renewable energy production to be matched with electric vehicle charge events anywhere in the world
   -Decarbonizing electricity by giving market participants a white label solution for granular and verifiable 247 renewable energy matching
   -Decarbonizing aviation by providing a single, global platform to help energy majors, airlines, airports, and businesses track the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel
   -Decarbonizing bitcoin by developing a renewable bitcoin mining certification for use by crypto producers, buyers, and intermediaries
   The company posseses an unfair advantage by providing unparalleled transparency in decarbonization efforts. Unlike competitors using blockchain for tokenized certificates, Green Proofs allows independent verification of producers’ attributes and data accuracy throughout supply chains. The vast consortium of over 100 energy partners gives EWC an advantage and trust that other competitors don’t have.
